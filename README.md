# Tattoo-studio-website
My very first website, a fictional tattoo shop.

This project started as a Codecademy assignment, but later I decided to make it a portfolio project.

My aim was to create a project to show my HTML and CSS knowledge, and I also used jQuery for the menu and java Script Lightbox gallery.

I focused mostly on practising flexbox in this project.

I had so much fun creating this webpage!
