# Tattoo-studio-website
My very first website, a fictional tattoo shop.

This is my first portfolio project.

My aim was to create a project to introduce my HTML and CSS knowledge, and I also used Lightbox gallery and jQuery for the navigation bar.

I focused mostly on practising flexbox and media queries.

I had so much fun creating this webpage!
